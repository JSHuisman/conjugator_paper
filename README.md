## Experimental Data

Time course assay in LB medium:
- Raw data of colony counts, dilution factors and cell densities are provided in the file ‘Time_course_DRT_raw_colonycounts_dilutionfactors.csv’. 
- Raw data of optical density measurements for monoculture growth rates in LB medium combined for all strains are provided in the file ‘Growth_OD_data_D_R_T_LBmedium.csv’. 
- *Processed data* used for conjugation rate estimation in the time course assay are provided in the file ‘Time_course_DRT.csv’. 

Full protocol in VL medium:
*Note: some of this data has been re-used as a small subset from [Duxbury et al., 2021](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2021.2027), and is available in the corresponding [Dryad repository](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.2jm63xsp7). The strains from Duxbury et al., 2021, relate to the strains used in the current study as follows: D = D’, R = R, T= T, ESBL375 = D.*
- Raw data of colony counts, dilution factors and cell densities are provided in the file ‘Full_protocol_DRT_TRT_raw_colonycounts_dilutionfactors.csv’. This data for the TRT assay has been re-used from the medium condition ‘1.0x_VL’ for t = 0, 4 in dataset ‘Dec19_raw_colony_counts_conjug_assay_20210326.csv’ ([Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.2jm63xsp7)). 
- Raw datasets of optical density data used as input for maximum growth rate estimation are provided on [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.2jm63xsp7) (the ‘1.0x_VL’ medium condition).
- *Processed data* used for conjugation rate estimation in the full protocol assay are provided in the file ‘Full_protocol_DRT_TRT.csv’. The growth rate values (psi values) for strains D, R and T presented in this dataset have been reused from the control medium condition ‘1.0x_VL’ in datasets ‘20201027_Growth_rates_D_R_T.csv’ and ‘20201027_Growth_rates_ESBL375.csv’ provided on [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.2jm63xsp7). The cell density values presented in ‘Full_protocol_DRT_TRT.csv’ have been reused as a small subset from the control medium condition ‘1.0x_VL’ for t = 0, 4 in dataset ‘Dec19_conjug_assay_cell_densities_t0_4_allreps.csv’.

The R script for logistic growth model fitting from OD data for the time course assay is provided as the file ‘Growth_Model_Logistic.R’. The R script for maximum growth rate fitting from OD data for the full protocol assay is provided as ‘calculateslope_new_growthrate.py’ in the Dryad repository. For the cell density values for t = 24 presented in ‘Full_protocol_DRT_TRT.csv’, two different dilution factors were used per strain per agar type for the two agar plate replicates. This cell density data is included in ‘Full_protocol_DRT_TRT_raw_colonycounts_dilutionfactors.csv’. Rather than taking a mean estimate based on colony counts at different dilutions, we assumed colony counts followed a Poisson distribution ([Zwart et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-018-0104-z)) and then minimized the negative log likelihood for all (non-zero) colony counts available for a sample. This approach yields a maximum likelihood estimate of cellular density that takes into account the error structure of the colony count data. The R script is provided as file ‘Poisson estimates.R’, from Mark Zwart (The Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW), Wageningen, The Netherlands).”
